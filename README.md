# Code for Manuscript: 
This repository contains the analysis scripts and data used for the manuscript titled "[Manuscript Title]". Each script corresponds to a specific figure in the paper and is labeled accordingly. This code was used to generate all results and visualizations included in the manuscript.


## Files and Figures
The files are organized by figure number. Below is a brief description of the structure:

*  Figure 1: figure1_script.R
*  Figure 2: figure2_analysis.R
*  Figure 3: figure3_plot.R
*  Figure 4: figure1_script.R
*  Figure 5: figure2_analysis.R
*  Figure 6: figure3_plot.R
*  Figure 7: figure1_script.R
*  Figure 8: figure2_analysis.R
*  Figure 9: figure3_plot.R
Each script contains all necessary steps to reproduce the analysis and figures presented in the manuscript. Be sure to follow the usage instructions and install the required dependencies.
